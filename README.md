# CardinalCall
This app aims to help users identify bird species by analyzing their calls using real-time audio matching. Inspired by music identification tools like Shazam, this project will use Appleâ€™s ShazamKit to create an offline audio catalog of bird calls, focusing specifically on species native to the Stanford area. Users tap a button to record nearby chirps, and the app matches the audio to a known species and then presents information and media about the bird.
## BirdCatalogGenerator
This is a command line application that generates the shazam catalog needed for CardinalCall.
